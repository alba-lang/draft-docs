\subsection{Universes and Sorts}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We have the following sorts or universes (sorts and universes are synonymous):
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Prop$: Impredicative universe of propositions

\item $\Any_i$: Predicative universes of types for $i \in \set{0, 1, 2, \ldots}$

\item $\Any_\infty$: Top universe
\end{enumerate}
and the builtin type $\Uni$ with the typing judgements which are treated as
axioms:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
    \Uni : \Any_\infty
    \\
    \Prop : \Any_0 : \Any_1 \ldots
\end{array}
$$


All sorts except the top sort $\Any_\infty$ have types. Therefore it is
possible to introduce type variables $X: s$ for all sorts except the top sort.

Furthermore since $\Uni$ has type $\Any_\infty$ it is possible to introduce
universe variables $u: \Uni$.

The type of a type is always a sort. The sort of a type defines the
universe of the type. I.e. all types live in a universe. The typing judgement
$T: s$ says that the type $T$ lives in the universe $s$.


There is a subtle difference between the universe of a type and the universe of
an object. An object has a type and its type lives in a universe. We say the an
\emph{object $o$ lives in a universe $s$ if its type $T$ lives in the universe
$s$}. I.e. the typing judgement $o : T : s$ must be valid. In other words $o$
has type $T$ and $T$ has type $s$.

A type $T$ can be regarded as a type. Then its type is a sort $s$ with $T : s$
and it therefore lives in the universe $s$ as a type.

However a type can be regarded as an object as well. Then there is the typing
judgement $T: s_1 : s_2$. We say the object $T$ lives in the universe $s_2$.

Some examples: The type $\Nat$ lives in the universe $\Any_0$. The object $1$
has type $\Nat$. Therefore the object $1$ lives in the universe $\Any_0$. The
object $\Nat$ has type $\Any_0$ which has the type $\Any_1$. Therefore the
object $\Nat$ lives in the universe $\Any_1$. By the same reasoning the object
$\Any_0$ lives in the universe $\Any_2$.

All types regarded as objects live in a universe higher than the types regarded
as types.




\subsection{Typing Rules}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Typing rules for products:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Propositional Products:
        $$
            \rulev{
                \Gamma \vdash A: s
                \\
                \Gamma, x^A \vdash B: \Prop
                \\
                A \ne \Uni
            }
            {
                \Gamma \vdash \Pi x^A. B : \Prop
            }
        $$
    \item Predicative Products:
        $$
            \rulev{
                \Gamma \vdash A: \Any_i
                \\
                \Gamma, x^A \vdash B: \Any_i
            }
            {
                \Gamma \vdash \Pi x^A. B : \Any_i
            }
        $$

    \item Universe Products:
        $$
            \rulev{
                \Gamma \vdash u: \Uni
                \\
                \Gamma, u^\Uni \vdash B: s
                \\
                A \ne \Uni
            }
            {
                \Gamma \vdash \Pi u^\Uni. B : \Any_\infty
            }
        $$
\end{enumerate}
These rules guarantee that the type $\Pi u^\Uni. B$ of a universe polymorphic
object cannot be used as an argument to a function.


Furthermore we have the cumulativity rule
$$
\rulev{
    \Gamma \vdash t : T
    \\
    \Gamma \vdash U : s
    \\
    T \le U
}
{
    \Gamma \vdash t : U
}
$$
The cumulativity rule for predicative universes says that whenever $T: \Any_i$
is valid, then $T: \Any_j$ is valid for all $i \le j$ since $\Any_i \le \Any_j$
is valid.  Together with the predicative product rule we get
$$
\rulev{
    \Gamma \vdash A: \Any_i
    \\
    \Gamma, x^A \vdash B: \Any_j
    \\
    i \le k
    \\
    j \le k
}
{
    \Gamma \vdash \Pi x^A.B : \Any_k
}
$$
or maybe more specific
$$
\rulev{
    \Gamma \vdash A: \Any_i
    \\
    \Gamma, x^A \vdash B: \Any_j
}
{
    \Gamma \vdash \Pi x^A.B : \Any_{\text{max}(i,j)}
}
$$






\subsection{Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Universe variables are always implicit. The programmer usually ommits universe
variables in the source code i.e. instead of $\Any_u$ the source code contains
only $\Any$. The compiler generates for each sort $\Any$ in the source code a
metavariable $\meta u : \Uni$ and interprets the sort $\Any$ as $\Any_{\meta
u}$.

There are the following two sources of constraints between universes.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Predicative type argument $T: \Any_{u}$: If $T$ is used as an actual
        argument e.g. in the expression $f T$, then the function $f$ must have
        the type $\Pi X^{\Any_v}. R$.  This creates the constraint $u \le v$.

    \item Predicative inductive type $\Pi \vec x^{\vec A}. \Any_{v}$: Any
        instance of such an inductive type lives in the universe $\Any_{v}$.

        This requires that all arguments of all contructors must not live in a
        higher universe. Reason: Pattern matches of an indutive type living in
        the universe $\Any_{v}$ must not uncover any object living in a
        higher universe. In other words: \emph{Only smaller (or equal) things
        can be used to create greater things}.

        I.e. any constructor argument living as an object in the universe
        $\Any_u$ creates the constraint $u \le v$.
\end{enumerate}






\subsection{Predicative Inductive Types}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In Alba new types can be created as inductive types. The simplest inductive
types have neither parameter nor index arguments.
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
    B &:=& [T^{\Any_0} \mid T, T]
    \\
    N &:=& [T^{\Any_0} \mid N, N \to N]
\end{array}
$$

The types of booleans and natural numbers live in the universe $\Any_0$ because
of the typing judgements $B: \Any_0$ and $N: \Any_0$. Objects of type boolean do
not contain anything. Objects of type $N$ might contain other natural numbers
(second constructor). There is no possibility for such simple types to contain
objects living in a higher universe than $\Any_0$.

Polymorphic types like lists and pairs have type parameters. The type parameters
can live in any universe. Therefore they need an universe level parameter and a
type parameter whhich depents on the uinverse level.

$$
\begin{array}{lllll}
    L &:=& [i^\Uni, A^{\Any_i} &\mid T^{\Any_i} &\mid T, A \to T \to T]
    \\
    P &:=& [i^\Uni, A^{\Any_i}, B^{\Any_i} &\mid T^{\Any_i} &\mid A \to B \to T]
\end{array}
$$

Having that we can construct a list of natural numbers $L\,0\,N: \Any_0$ living
in the universe level $0$. However it is possible to construct list of types
$L\,(i+1)\,\Any_i$ which might live in the universe level $i$. The types as
types live in the universe level $i$, but the types as objects live in the
universe level $i+1$. Therefore the whole list which contains objects from the
universe level $i + 1$ lives in the universe level $i+1$ as well.


A more complex type is the dependent list.
$$
\begin{array}{lllll}
    \text{DL} &:=&
    [
        i^\Uni, A^{\Any_i}, P^{A \to \Any_i}
        &\mid
        T^{LiA \to \Any_i}
        &\mid
        T[],
        \Pi a^A \text{as}^{LiA}.
            Pa \to T\text{as} \to T(a :: \text{as})
    ]
\end{array}
$$

A dependent list might contain objects of type $A$, $LiA$, $Pa$ and
$T\text{as}$. All these object live in the universe level $i$. Therefore the
whole dependent list can live in the universe level $i$.

Furthermore we can construct hetergeneous lists.
$$
\begin{array}{lllll}
    \text{HL} &:=&
    [
        i^\Uni
        &\mid
        T^{L(i+1)\Any_i \to \Any_{i+1}}
        &\mid
        T[],
        \Pi A^{\Any_i} \text{As}^{L(i+1)\Any_i}.
            A \to T\text{As} \to T(A :: \text{As})
    ]
\end{array}
$$
A heterogeneous list contains objects $A$ and $\text{As}$ with the typing
judgements $A : \Any_i : \Any_{i+1}$, $\text{As}: L(i+1)\Any_i : \Any_{i+1}$.
These objects live in the universe level $i+1$. Therefore the whole
heterogeneous list object must live in the universe level $i+1$ as well.


Here is a rather strange type
$$
\begin{array}{lllll}
    \text{Ex}
    &:=&
    [
        i^\Uni,
        P^{\Any_i \to \Prop}
        &\mid
        T^{\Any_{i+1}}
        &\mid
        \Pi X^{\Any_i}. P X \to T
    ]
\end{array}
$$




\subsection{No Universe Polymorphism}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

No universe polymorphis means that all user entered $\Any$ are interpreted as
$\Any_0$. Therefore all types live as types at the universe level $0$ and all
objects which are not types live as well at the universe level $0$. Types as
objects live at the universe level $1$.

This has an important consequence: \emph{Type objects cannot be contained within
other objects}. There is no list of types, no pair of types etc.

Of the above examples nearly all types are possible without universe
polymorphism. Only heterogeneous lists $\text{HL}$ and the strange type
$\text{Ex}$ are not possible without universe polymorphism.

Without universe polymorphism we are basically in the calculus of constructions
with inductive types. All construction which require an infinite set of
stratified universes with cumulativity are not possible.
